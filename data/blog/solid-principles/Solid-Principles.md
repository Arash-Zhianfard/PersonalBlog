# Solid Principles

These are principles that you may have heard of it If you are familiar with Object-Oriented Programming or you may have been asked in an interview.

The SOLID principles were introduced or improved by Robert C. Martin back to early-2000s. Back then developers were satisfied with OOP languages since they were writhing less code and also more cleaner code comparing to Procedural Programming but the problem was the more softwares became complex and bigger the more effort needed to maintain them so every little change or adding a small feature required too much modifications in code base.

let's see what exactly the solid principles are and how they help use to improve our code quality.

Simply put, if you want your project to be less complex, maintainable and flexible you need to learn them.

In following links I explained the detail for each principle
