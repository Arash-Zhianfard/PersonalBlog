I started programming with VB6 when I was 16 .I've tried different programming languages such as C++, Java, Delphi etc but my dominant language is C# .

Recently I started learning ReactJs and found it very interesting but still deeply love backend programming ;).

In this blog I'll try to share with you what I'll learned and I hope you like it.
